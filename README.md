C Libraries for PIC24

### In-depth documentation will be made available in the Github Pages section. Coming soon.

## Quick Info

- This library was written specifically for deployment on the PIC24FJ64GA002. **I cannot guarantee that these libraries will work on all PIC24 devices without some modification.** If modifications are needed, they should be trivial.
- This library was compiled using Microchip's XC16 compiler.
- The IDE used for creating this library is Microchip's MPLAB-X v4.00
